///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is NOT safe to use if other threads are interacting with files, networking, or
/// anything else that could possibly involve file descriptors in any way, shape, or form. (Note: On
/// some systems, file descriptor use may be more common than you think! For example, on Linux with
/// musl libc, `std::fs::canonicalize()` will open a file descriptor to the given path.)
///
/// In addition, some objects, such as `std::fs::File`, may open file descriptors and then assume
/// that they will remain open. This function, by closing those file descriptors, violates those
/// assumptions.
///
/// This function is safe to use if it can be verified that these are not concerns. For example, it
/// *should* be safe at startup or just before an `exec()`. At all other times, exercise extreme
/// caution when using this function, as it may lead to race conditions and/or security issues.
///
/// # Efficiency
///
/// ## Efficiency of using `keep_fds`
///
/// **TL;DR**: If you're going to be passing more than a few file descriptors in `keep_fds`, sort
/// the slice first for best performance.
///
/// On some systems, the `keep_fds` list may see massive numbers of lookups, especially if it
/// contains high-numbered file descriptors.
///
/// If `keep_fds` is sorted, since `iter_open_fds()` goes in ascending order it is easy to check
/// for the presence of a given file descriptor in `keep_fds`. However, because `close_fds` is a
/// `#![no_std]` crate, it can't allocate memory for a *copy* of `keep_fds` that it can sort.
///
/// As a result, this function first checks if `keep_fds` is sorted. If it is, the more efficient
/// method can be employed. If not, it falls back on `.contains()`. which can be very slow.
