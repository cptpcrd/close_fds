/// Iterate over all open file descriptors for the current process, starting at `minfd`. The file
/// descriptors are guaranteed to be returned in ascending order.
///
/// # Warnings
///
/// **TL;DR**: Don't use this function in multithreaded programs unless you know what you're doing,
/// and avoid opening/closing file descriptors while consuming this iterator.
///
/// 1. File descriptors that are opened *during* iteration may or may not be included in the results
///    (exact behavior is platform-specific and depends on several factors).
///
/// 2. **IMPORTANT**: On some platforms, if other threads open file descriptors at very specific
///    times during a call to `FdIter::next()`, that may result in other file descriptors being
///    skipped. Use with caution. (If this is a problem for you, use
///    [`iter_open_fds_threadsafe()`], which avoids this issue).
///
/// 3. *Closing* file descriptors during iteration (in the same thread or in another thread) will
///    not affect the iterator's ability to list other open file descriptors (if it does, that is a
///    bug). However, in most cases you should use [`close_open_fds()`] to do this.
///
/// 4. Some of the file descriptors yielded by this iterator may be in active use by other sections
///    of code. Be very careful about which operations you perform on them.
///
///    If your program is multi-threaded, this is especially true, since a file descriptor returned
///    by this iterator may have been closed by the time your code tries to do something with it.

/// operation that implicitly checks if the file descriptor is valid. For example:
///
/// ```
/// use std::os::unix::io::FromRawFd;
///
/// for fd in close_fds::iter_possible_fds(0) {
///     let file = unsafe { std::fs::File::from_raw_fd(fd) };
///     let _meta = match file.metadata() {
///         Ok(m) => m,
///         Err(e) if e.raw_os_error() == Some(libc::EBADF) => {
///             std::mem::forget(file);  // Don't try to close() it
///             continue;
///         }
///         Err(e) => panic!(e),
///     };

///     // ...

/// apply to this function as well.
